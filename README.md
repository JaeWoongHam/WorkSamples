# Work Samples
For demonstration or employment purposes only. Please find my compiled list of projects below:

1) API R Package (Done in R)
Built an API encased in R package that entailed multiple functions that utilize Consumer Financial Bureau Complaint Database API endpoints to draw data and provide actionable insights. Data was preprocessed by fixing geographical data, remapping classification, and tackling missing or incomplete data.

2) HDB Resale Prediction Machine Learning Models (Done in Python)
Conducted EDA using quantitative and qualitative methods on HDB resale flat transactions from 1990 to 2020, and built predictive models to determine future resale values of HDB flat.

3) Coronavirus Forecast Model (Done in R)
Used ARMA models and sigmoid function fitted with spline to predict future coronavirus cases based on past historical data. The code and report are included separately for this project.

4) Deep Learning Model using Keras (Done in Python)
Preprocessed UN World Happiness Survey data using scalars, transformers and encoders, and fitted a Keras deep neural network model to predict happiness. Final model was used to predict happiness within a production ready scalable rest API via ONNX.

5) Statistical Analysis Report (Done in R)
Conducted regression analyses of relationship between socioeconomic factors and consumer trust of online news outlets to determine which variables have the highest predictive power, and optimized models by testing for different assumptions.

6) Research Seminar with IBM – Collaborative NLP Project at Columbia University (Combination of Python and R)
Developed NLP models to conduct sentiment analysis, and implemented predictive analytics to forecast future consumer complaints based on historical patterns. All features were embedded and published in a R Shiny App. It also includes a scoring mechanism based on urgency to deliver greater business value.
