# IBM Project
The custom R package that utilize Consumer Financial Bureau Complaint Database API endpoints to extract and preprocess data is an individual project. 
However, the core skeletal scripts for the NLP and ML models were a collaborative effort by my team and IBM. Please note that the API package was done in R, while the models were developed using Python.
As such, the collaborative component is part of IBM's property, and only the link to the R package can be shown.
