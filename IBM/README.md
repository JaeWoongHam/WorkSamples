# IBM Project
The custom R package that utilize Consumer Financial Bureau Complaint Database API endpoints to extract and preprocess data is an individual project. 
However, the core skeletal scripts developed for NLP and ML models were a collaborative effort by my team and IBM. 
As such, the collaborative component is part of IBM's property, and only the link to the R package can be shown.
